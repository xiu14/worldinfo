**If you are using a _Text Completion_ profile, make sure your profile contains API, preset, model, system prompt, instruct template, and  context template.**

**If you are using a _Chat Completion_ profile; API, settings, model would be enough.**

## FAQ

>Can I use this with my local 8B/12B RP model?

You should test it, but my guess is no. Because the model needs to give _XML_ output. RP models might not be able to do that.

>Can you suggest a model?

Gemini models are cheap, fast, and efficient. I usually use Gemini Flash 2.0. But most decent models should work fine.

> I'm getting "No results from AI/Invalid XML" error.

- Make sure your max response tokens are set high enough to accommodate the response. Try increasing it to 2000/more. Or prompt the entry limit to a smaller number. Like *"Only give me a maximum of 2 entries."*
- Please don't try to use a fancy chat completion preset. They are made for RP. Not for generating structured XML output. So, create a connection profile with the default preset.
- As I said in the first question, make sure your model is capable of generating structured XML output.
