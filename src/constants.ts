export const DEFAULT_ST_DESCRIPTION = `=== SILLYTAVERN===

**SillyTavern** is a popular open-source front-end interface designed for interacting with AI language models. It's primarily used for role-playing, creative writing, and conversational experiences, offering a user-friendly platform to customize interactions with AI. Here's an overview:

### Key Features:
1. **AI Backend Compatibility**: Works with APIs like OpenAI (GPT), KoboldAI, Claude, or local models (via services like Text-generation-webui or Ollama).
2. **Customization**:
   - Create and import character cards (with personas, scenarios, and dialogue examples).
   - Adjust model parameters (temperature, repetition penalties) for tailored responses.
3. **Plugins & Extensions**: Adds features like text-to-speech, image generation, emotion recognition, and world-building tools.
4. **Privacy**: Self-hosted locally, giving users control over data (unlike cloud-based services).

### Use Cases:
- Role-playing with AI characters.
- Collaborative storytelling or creative writing.
- Experimental AI interactions (users often share character templates and scripts in communities).

### Requirements:
- Technical setup involves installing Node.js, cloning the GitHub repo, and configuring API connections.
- Requires access to an AI model backend (e.g., OpenAI API key or a locally hosted model).

### Community & Ethics:
- Active communities on platforms like GitHub and Reddit share guides, characters, and plugins.
- Encourages responsible use, as the tool can generate unrestricted content depending on the AI backend.

SillyTavern is not an AI itself but a flexible interface to enhance interactions with LLMs.

=== WORLDINFO (LOREBOOKS) ===

**World Info** (often called **Lorebooks**) is a feature used in AI-driven storytelling and role-playing platforms (like SillyTavern, NovelAI, KoboldAI, or Text-generation-webui) to help AI models maintain consistency in fictional worlds. It acts as a dynamic knowledge base that the AI references during interactions to avoid contradictions and keep track of key details.

---

### **What is World Info/Lorebooks?**
- **A structured database**: Stores details about characters, locations, rules, events, or concepts in your fictional world.
- **Contextual triggers**: Entries activate automatically when specific keywords or phrases appear in the conversation/story.
- **Prevents "amnesia"**: Ensures the AI remembers critical lore without relying solely on its limited context window.

---

### **How It Works**
1. **Create Entries**: Define elements (e.g., a character’s backstory, a magic system’s rules).
2. **Set Triggers**: Link entries to keywords (e.g., mention "Dragonstone" → inject lore about that location).
3. **Dynamic Injection**: When a trigger word appears in the chat/story, the relevant entry is temporarily added to the AI’s context.

---

### **Key Features**
- **Hierarchy**: Organize entries into categories (e.g., factions, items, timelines).
- **Priority**: Set which entries take precedence if multiple triggers occur.
- **Cross-references**: Link entries to each other (e.g., a character entry references their home city).
- **Formatting**: Use markdown, JSON, or plain text depending on the platform.

---

### **Example Lorebook Entry**
\`\`\`plaintext
Name: Dragonstone Citadel
Triggers: Dragonstone, Citadel, Obsidian Fortress
Content:
  A volcanic fortress built from black obsidian. Home to the ancient Order of Flames,
  who guard the Eternal Fire—a magical flame that grants visions of the future.
  The citadel is rumored to be cursed, as its rulers never live past 40 years.
\`\`\`

---

### **Use Cases**
1. **Complex Worldbuilding**: Track political factions, religions, or history.
2. **Character Consistency**: Ensure the AI remembers a character’s motives, secrets, or relationships.
3. **Magic/Science Systems**: Define rules (e.g., "Magic drains lifeforce" or "Robots cannot harm humans").
4. **Plot Hooks**: Store hidden clues or foreshadowing for the AI to weave into the narrative.

---

### **Tools Supporting Lorebooks**
- **SillyTavern**: Integrates with lorebooks via extensions or prompts.
- **NovelAI**: Has a built-in "Lorebook" feature with advanced triggers.
- **KoboldAI/Text-generation-webui**: Use "world info" files or scripts.
- **AIDungeon** (historically): Early adopter of world info, though less popular now.

---

### **Best Practices**
- **Keep entries concise**: AI models process information best in short, clear snippets.
- **Balance detail**: Too many entries can overwhelm the context window.
- **Test triggers**: Ensure keywords are unique enough to avoid false activations.
- **Update dynamically**: Add/remove entries as the story evolves.

Lorebooks are essential for long-term storytelling with AI.`;
